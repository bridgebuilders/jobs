Email:   Dear Joshua Project II friends,
 
May the Lord bless you daily in His work!    My wife and I are
missionaries serving in Japan and I am writing today to let you know of the need to edit your people group listing.

Needed Edit:
(1) Change all references to the Japanese people group currently
listed as ""Eta"" to ""Burakumin"".
Rationale:  The term ""Eta"" is a strong pejorative term.  Use of this
term indicates an extreme bias against or even hatred of the people group. Definitely not the message we are trying to convey.  If you  need to confirm this information, you may refer to the description provided by secular political activists belonging to this peole group at http://blhrri.org/blhrri_e/blhrri/buraku.htm.

Thank you and God bless you!",,"TW",10/4/2000 0:00:00
