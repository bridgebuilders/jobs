This is the only part of Indonesia that has implemented Shari’I law, for certain situations.
The history of Aceh is one of centuries of conflict with Dutch and British colonial powers, and since 1949 the Indonesian army, all seeking control of its strategic position and natural resources. This has made the Aceh people hostile to Christianity.
The 2004 Asian tsunami killed more than 200,000 people, most of them in Aceh province. The tsunami effectually ended the decades-old uprising of the Aceh against Indonesian rule. There were fewer than 400 Christians before the tsunami, but there have been recent increases in this number. Many Indonesian and foreign Christians came to the aid of the victims, which gained considerable credit for the Gospel.
There are indications the Aceh people were exposed to Hinduism in the past, but today are often considered the most conservative Muslim group in all of Indonesia. They have been very instrumental in spreading Islam throughout Indonesian and other Southeast Asian countries.
Orthodox Islam for many Aceh people is combined with animistic beliefs in spirits and various superstitions. These beliefs center on seeking protection through magic by either appeasing or controlling both good and bad spirits.
Pray those in the Aceh people cluster will allow Christians to help them in various ways, and that they will realize the love of Christ is the motivating factor.",,,4.00,3.00,101.50,"BM",10/30/2003 0:00:00

They prefer to be known as the Afar, since the Arabic word danakil is an offensive term to them.They began to convert to Islam in the 10th century after contact with Arabs. The brand of Islam they practice is heavily syncretic and includes many elements of their older, indigenous religion, (focused on the Sky God).
The ancestors of the Afar settled farm land in the Ethiopian highlands some time before AD 1000 and primarily raised livestock. Some time after this they began a gradual transition to a more nomadic lifestyle and moved to the area they currently occupy. Since then they have been involved in many conflicts with bordering tribes and peoples.
Traditionally the society is ruled by sultanates made up of several villages, headed by a 'dardar'. Afar are organised into clan families, and into classes - asaimara ('reds') who are the dominant class politically, and the adoimara ('whites') who are a working class and usually live in the desert.
The Afar are nominally Muslim, but a minimal level of orthodoxy in practice is attained only in the coastal regions and in the sultanates. The nomads of the interior are lax, and, though they hold Islam in great esteem, their own practices are more in line with the earlier Cushitic religion.
The Afar subsistence economy depends on livestock, especially goats, some camels, and, more rarely, cattle. There are some exceptions, such as fishermen in the coastal areas and agriculturalists in the Assau oasis. The Afar also mine and export salt.
Those who live in the desert inhabit one of the most rugged regions in the world, known as the Afar Plain or the Danakil Desert. The Afar live in camps surrounded by thorn barricades, which protect them from the attacks of wild animals or enemy tribesmen.
Spirits of the dead are believed to be very powerful, and a ""feast of the dead,"" called Rabena, is celebrated each year. They also give annual offerings to the sea to ensure safety for their villages.

The Aimaq language does not have recorded scripture available, nor does it have Gospel recordings or other media. However, many Aimaq people now also speak other languages, such as Dari, which do have resources available.
The term Aimaq is probably derived from the Turkish ""Eimak"", which means tribe.
Once nomadic peoples, they were forced by cycles of severe drought and war into semi-nomadic lives, traveling seasonally to graze decimated herds and/or subsisting as sedentary farmers and carpet weavers in mud-brick villages.
There are no reports of followers of Jesus Christ among the 2,000,000 individuals in the Aimaq cluster. They have few if any resources available in their traditional language. They are largely cutoff from the life-giving message of Christ.

Arabs of the Levant speak a version of Arabic referred to as Levantine Arabic, North and South. The way Levantine Arabic is spoken varies significantly between urban, rural, and nomadic areas.
The region of the Levant (Greater Syria, as it was known) was under Roman rule for seven centuries before being invaded by Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula shortly after the death of Mohammed in 632AD. Muslim presence in the Levant has continued to the present day, after this successful invasion. Even so, the area was predominately Christian for hundreds of years after the conquest.
The Levant has a long history of being quite cosmopolitan, with early influences from France, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. “Travelers were astonished and attracted by the variety of races and costumes in these cities and the juxtaposition of mosques, churches and synagogues.” Levantine cities have been noted for bringing modernity and education, the antithesis of today's fundamentalist Islam.

Although modernization has changed the Bedouin lifestyle somewhat, emphasis is placed on teaching children to carry on traditional ways of life, and the advancement of modern technology is not considered important to children's education.
Modern societies have made the traditional nomadic Bedouin lifestyle less attractive since it is demanding and often dangerous. Because of that, many tribes have settled in urban areas. Today, the Arabs have one of the highest rates of urbanization in the world.
Prayer is an integral part of Bedouin life. As there are no formal mosques in the desert, Bedouins living in the traditional manner pray where they are, facing Mecca and performing the ritual washing, preferably with water. Since water is not always readily available, they 'wash' with sand instead.
Bedouins are almost untouched by the gospel. Christian resources are available in the Arabic language, the Bedouin's mother tongue.

Joshua Project shows the primary religion of the Japanese to be Buddhist, but this is a simplification.

Materialism is perhaps the real religion of many people.
The Burakumin people group within the Japanese cluster have been a marginalized group, made up of the eta (defiled ones), and the hinin (non-human ones). The feudal caste system of Japan, ending in about 1870, was responsible. Discrimination against these people may still sometimes occur, in marriage and employment situations.
Christianity has been in Japan since the 16th century, when Roman Catholics from Portugal entered the country. Protestant missionary work began in the late 19th century.
The full Bible has been available in the Japanese language since 1883, and many other Christian resources are available, as well. Access to the Gospel by those in the Japanese cluster is not generally restricted.  The problem is lack of interest.

Madura are a proud and purposeful people, known as fierce fighters and very hard workers. They are said to be the most loyal of friends but the fiercest of enemies. The Madura are renowned for their harsh character and lifestyles, probably caused by their natural surroundings and their history of oppression by others, both of which have made life very difficult for them.
The Madura have their own language as well as several dialects. The Bangkalan dialect is used in the regencies of Bangkalan and Sampang. The Pamekasan dialect is used in the southern portion of Pamekasan Regency and in the central part of Madura Island. The Sumenep dialect is found in the Sumenep Regency. There are also the Girpapas and Kangean dialects that are used by smaller populations.
On average, the Madura live on one-third of the median Indonesian income. Education beyond middle school is an immense need for the Madura people, as is job skills training.
The majority of the Madura are known for being very devout Sunni Muslims. Nevertheless, many seek security from the use of magic spells that are used in an attempt to control both good and evil spirits.",,,4.00,1.00,112.70,"BM",10/30/2003 0:00:00

The population consists of a mix of people who trace their descent from Sri Lanka, India, Arab countries, and Africa. Because of religious and linguistic homogeneity, there is stability and unity.
Virtually all Maldivians are Sunni Muslims. Islam is the country's state religion. Daily life is regulated according to the tenets of Islam and government regulations too are based on Islamic law. The law of the country prohibits the practice of any other religion by the country's citizens. However, the widespread belief in jinns, or evil spirits, has resulted in a blending of Islam with traditional island beliefs into a magico-religious system known as fandita.
The political, judicial, and religious systems in Maldives are so closely intertwined that the political leaders and judges are also the country's religious leaders.

Most of the languages spoken by the Nuristani tribes are unwritten, and literacy rates are low even for the written languages. Oral communication is essential. The Gospel must come to these people in oral form.

Zoroaster's philosophy was that the essence of human existence was the struggle between truth and untruth. The purpose of humankind, and all of creation, is to sustain truth.
A fire temple is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere fire in any form. Fire, together with clean water, are agents of ritual purity. The Zoroastrian cult of fire is much younger than Zoroastrianism itself.
Ancestor worship is an emphasized aspect of worship. Pictures of deceased loved ones hang in homes and are prayed and bowed to. Parsees respect other faith systems and gods. The Bible is treated honorably as a religious text and Christ is also seen in a positive light.
Some Persian Parsees migrated to India in around 800-1000 AD, to escape persecution from Muslims.",,,4.00,36.20,65.40,"BM",10/30/2003 0:00:00

The law that matters is Pashtunwali, a traditional system that relies on interlocking webs of deep relationships in order to function. Pashtun life is all about multigenerational relationships,and every agreement is based on a personal relationship.
A prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes. The Pashtuns remain a predominantly tribal people, but the worldwide trend of urbanisation has begun to alter Pashtun society. Despite this trend of urbanisation, many people still identify themselves with various clans.
The majority of the Taliban are made up of Pashtun tribesmen, but only a tiny fraction of Pashtun are Taliban.

The majority of the Talysh are farmers. Traditional Talysh homes had no furniture. However, today, a growing number of homes have adopted Western-style furnishings. Talysh women once wore traditional Muslim clothing, but today most wear Western style clothing.
People living in the Talysh mountains have a history of being exceptionally long-lived, but this may be changing.
The Talysh are Muslim Shias. Some remnants of Talysh pre-Islamic religion remain. For example they have a reverence for trees and groves, and trees form some of their most sacred sites. They also believe in the presence of both good and evil spirits, with the most dangerous spirit being Alazhan, the 'Red Woman'.

In the fourteenth century Christianity disappeared from among the Uygur for 500 years, and they converted to Islam. The Swedish Missionary Society recommenced work among the Uygur in 1892.

This community is not defined by language spoken, as is true of almost all communities of India. Rather, it is defined by common history and cultural / societal values. They have been a nomadic people, and have been likened to gypsies. However, at the present time the name Banjara may refer more to a trading community than to a nomadic community.
The Banjara are made up of several gotras, or clans. Members of the same gotra cannot marry, because they are considered brothers and sisters.
Their traditional caste (jati) council, the panchayat, consists of the elderly members of the village.  The council settles cases related to inheritance disputes, payment of loans, divorce, settlement or payment of bride-price, etc.
Banjara deify ancestors, and saints are worshipped and revered. Their priests interface with ancestors and interpret omens, dreams, miraculous stories and magic.  Their deities include Samkimata, Waghai Mai, Kalika, Asavari and Banjari Devi.
Scripture is available in the language spoken by most Banjara, but the literacy rate for the people is low. The Gospel needs to come to the Banjara in oral form, as well as in written form for those who can read.",,,4.00,22.00,83.30,"BM",5/4/2011 0:00:00
